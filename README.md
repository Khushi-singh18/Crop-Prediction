# ðŸŒ¾ Crop Prediction Web Application

A machine learning-based web app that predicts the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil and weather conditions. Built using Python, Flask, HTML, and CSS, and trained on real agricultural data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project uses a machine learning model trained on agricultural data to recommend the best crop to grow based on input parameters like:

- Nitrogen (N)
- Phosphorus (P)
- Potassium (K)
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall

The frontend is built using HTML and styled with CSS, while the backend runs on Flask and serves predictions using a trained model.
